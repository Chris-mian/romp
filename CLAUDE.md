# romp — repo instructions

## Philosophy
The bottleneck in AI coding is human attention. romp lets one person direct a
whole fleet of agents by spending that attention where it counts and surfacing
only what is worth acting on, so they keep the focus and flow that good work needs
while running many agents at once. Every feature should serve that aim:
- **Spend attention, don't drain it.** A feature should take load off the user's
  working memory, not add to it. Glanceable by default; mechanics one click away.
- **Make re-engagement cheap.** Speak in the user's terms, the outcome and the
  why, never the agent's play-by-play, so picking a thread back up costs a glance.
- **Interrupt only when the human is the bottleneck.** "Needs you" means a
  decision only they can make. Waiting on a peer, a build, or another session is
  not that. Every false interrupt is a broken flow state.
- **Scale to parallelism.** Features should hold up across many concurrent
  sessions and let agents coordinate among themselves, handling the details the
  user never needs to see.
- **Never lose the thread.** Context persists, dead sessions revive with their
  history, nothing important silently drops, so stepping away is safe.

## Privacy — no real session data or personal identifiers in this repo
This repo may go public; assume every commit is permanent and world-readable.
- **Never copy real recorded data into the repo** — no real prompts,
  transcripts, per-turn summaries, postal messages, or message ids, not even
  "just one" to reproduce a bug. When a real session triggers a bug, write a
  SYNTHETIC reproduction: invented prompt text, placeholder UUIDs
  (`11111111-2222-...`), hostname `TESTHOST`. Live data belongs only under
  `~/.local/state/romp/` and `~/.claude/` (both outside the repo).
- **No personal identifiers** in code, comments, fixtures, docs, or commit
  messages: no names, machine/host names, vault names, emails, or absolute
  home paths (use `$HOME`/`~`).
- `tests/test_no_personal_identifiers.py` enforces this mechanically (local
  hostname, home path, plus `~/.config/romp/private-strings.txt`); run it
  before committing fixtures.

## Testing
Every bug fix or feature change must land with a test that covers it (user rule,
2026-06-12). Test homes: `tests/test_romp_events_golden.py` and the other
`tests/test_*.py` for the Python pipeline (`bin/`), `tests/*.bats` for shell
surfaces. Reproduce the bug in a failing test first when practical; fixtures
live in `tests/fixtures/`.

## Design
Prefer exact event-based mechanisms over time-based heuristics (grace periods,
debounces, age thresholds). If a time window seems needed, find the event it is
approximating and key on that event instead.

### The accent color is light blue `#9cd2ff` — use `var(--accent)`
The romp accent is light blue `#9cd2ff` (`--accent` in `ui/webview/styles.css`, with
`--accent-fg: #0c1a2e` for text on it). Use it for accent/highlight chrome — selected
toggles, in-progress loading dots, the Fleet pill, focus cues — anywhere you want "the
romp blue." Do NOT use it for STATUS colors, which keep their own meaning: working =
`--st-working-bg` (yellow), blocked/API-error = red, ready = `--st-ready-bg`, compacting =
teal. New accent chrome should reference `var(--accent)`, never re-hardcode the hex.

### Loading/waiting states: show the romp loader FIRST
Anytime something is loading, parsing, or otherwise making the user wait, the FIRST
thing to put up is the romp loader animation — the spinning swirl glyph
(`/media/romp-swirl-glyph.svg`, reverse spin) + the "romp" wordmark + three pulsing
accent-blue (`#9cd2ff`) dots — centered over the waiting surface, fading the instant
real content arrives (event-based; a backstop timeout so it can never trap the user).
It's the boot splash (`_landing` `#romp-boot`) and every pane's loader (`_pane_spin`).
Reuse that treatment for any new wait state rather than a blank, a bare spinner, or
text — a consistent "something's happening, it's romp" beats a frozen-looking screen.
A determinate progress bar is even better *when real progress is knowable*; default to
the loader animation otherwise.

### Buttons must stay click-safe across re-renders, and always acknowledge
The dashboard re-renders on every kernel push (a 0.5–3s backstop, plus an
immediate push per SDK stream event and per hook `/tick`). A control whose action
is hung on a DOM node that a re-render rebuilds gets destroyed mid-click — a
native `click` needs mousedown AND mouseup on the same element, so a rebuild
between them silently drops the click. That is the "had to click it several
times" bug. Every interactive control MUST therefore:

1. **Be click-safe across re-renders.** Never attach the action to a node you
   rebuild. Either:
   - **Delegate** to a STABLE ancestor — the container fetched by id survives
     `replaceChildren()`; only its children are swapped — and key the action off a
     `data-act` attribute. Use the shared helper `ui/webview/actions.ts`
     (`delegate(root, handlers)`), installed ONCE per root, never in a render
     loop. This is the default for HTML lists (chat tab bar `#tabs`, Fleet
     `#fleet-list`). A click whose original target was swapped mid-press still
     bubbles to the stable ancestor, so it always lands.
   - For full-canvas redraw surfaces (the SVG timeline) where threading every
     action param through data-attrs is impractical, **defer the rebuild while a
     pointer is pressed** over the surface and flush on `pointerup`/`pointercancel`
     (event-based, not a time heuristic), so the pressed element survives the
     click. See `ui/romp-timeline-view.js` `draw()`'s `_pointerHeld` guard.
2. **Always acknowledge the click immediately**, before any kernel round-trip —
   so the user never re-clicks because "nothing happened." `actions.ts`'s
   `flash()` adds a layout-safe `.romp-acted` press pulse on every delegated
   activation; a button that posts-and-waits (e.g. feed Nudge) must also disable +
   change its own label on click and self-restore. The error / dialog / result
   follows the acknowledgement; it does not replace it.

Reuse `ui/webview/actions.ts` for any new dashboard control. (`.romp-acted` is
defined in both `styles.css` and `feed.css` since the feed page loads only the
latter.)
