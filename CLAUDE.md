# romp — repo instructions

## Privacy — no real session data or personal identifiers in this repo
This repo may go public; assume every commit is permanent and world-readable.
- **Never copy real recorded data into the repo** — no real prompts,
  transcripts, per-turn summaries, postal messages, or message ids, not even
  "just one" to reproduce a bug. When a real session triggers a bug, write a
  SYNTHETIC reproduction: invented prompt text, placeholder UUIDs
  (`11111111-2222-...`), hostname `TESTHOST`. Live data belongs only under
  `~/.local/state/romp/` and `~/.claude/` (both outside the repo).
- **No personal identifiers** in code, comments, fixtures, docs, or commit
  messages: no names, machine/host names, vault names, emails, or absolute
  home paths (use `$HOME`/`~`).
- `tests/test_no_personal_identifiers.py` enforces this mechanically (local
  hostname, home path, plus `~/.config/romp/private-strings.txt`); run it
  before committing fixtures.

## Testing
Every bug fix or feature change must land with a test that covers it (user rule,
2026-06-12). Test homes: `tests/test_romp_events_golden.py` and the other
`tests/test_*.py` for the Python pipeline (`bin/`), `tests/*.bats` for shell
surfaces. Reproduce the bug in a failing test first when practical; fixtures
live in `tests/fixtures/`.

## Design
Prefer exact event-based mechanisms over time-based heuristics (grace periods,
debounces, age thresholds). If a time window seems needed, find the event it is
approximating and key on that event instead.
