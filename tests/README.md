# tests/ — every suite in one place

Every bug fix or feature change lands with a test (repo rule). Four suites:

- **`test_*.py`** (pytest) — the Python pipeline: event model, judges, kernel,
  backends, postal. They load the sources by file path via `SourceFileLoader`
  (through the stable `bin/` names) and isolate state with `XDG_STATE_HOME`.
  Golden transcript fixtures: `test_romp_events_golden.py` + `fixtures/`.
  Run: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` (~20s; a stalled run is a hang, not slow).
- **`*.bats`** — the shell surfaces: `bin/romp`, the launch chain, hooks,
  postal CLI. Keep them GNU/BSD-portable (CI runs bats on ubuntu).
  Run: `bats tests/*.bats`.
- **node suites** — live beside their sources in `ui/webview/*.test.ts` and
  `vscode-extension/src/*.test.ts`, run with `npm test` from
  `vscode-extension/`. Many pin lines of `kernel/kernel.py` as strings — run
  BOTH this and pytest on every kernel change.
- **`manager-restart.test.js`** — the node supervisor (`bin/romp-manager`).

`fixtures/` must stay SYNTHETIC: invented prompts, placeholder UUIDs, hostname
`TESTHOST` — never real session data. `test_no_personal_identifiers.py`
enforces this mechanically; run it before committing new fixtures.
