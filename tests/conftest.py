"""Global test isolation (2026-07-07): point XDG_STATE_HOME at a fresh temp dir BEFORE any test module
loads bin/romp-judge or bin/romp-kernel — both resolve their state root at import time. Without this,
any test that skips its own rebind writes into the REAL ~/.local/state/romp (the diary guard's
judge-errors.jsonl lines from legacy-flag fixtures made that visible). conftest.py imports before every
test module, so this is a suite-wide floor; per-class _rebind_state/tempdir isolation still layers on
