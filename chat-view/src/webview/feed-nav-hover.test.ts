// Feed modal sub-node nav + hover (the user 2026-06-16): clicking a sub-item in a card's tree must
// jump to where THAT step happened, and hovering it must light THAT step's timeline bars — not the
// top-level goal's. Both used to key on the top (it.t / the goal-node id), so every sub-item pointed
// at the initial message and sub-node hover never lit anything (it emitted a goal-node id, which the
// timeline matches against SEGMENT ids). No jsdom harness — pin at source level, like the sibling tests.
